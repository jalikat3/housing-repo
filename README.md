# nonlinear-housing-prediction
This is the code used for my machine learning project, which I will be presenting as a lightning talk at the MINK WIC
conference in October 2023.

The code is based off of our given code in class, but I updated the code to meet the program requirements, and the dataset.
The current data set can be found with this link:

If downloading, placethe dataset in the same folder as the code to run properly. Depending on your system, additional
data cleansing operations may be needed, but overall I was able to download and run properly.

## Overview
There are a few different code files, but the one to run the graph properly is ols_nonlinear_plot.py.
An additional download of DU lib will be neccesary. This can be found at: [Link](https://github.com/sj-simmons/DUlib/blob/master/README.md#top)
>  - ols_housing.py - my code for the linear model
>  - ols_housing_update_with_momentum.py - added momentum to the model
>  - ols_nonlinear_plot.py - run non-linear model with the graph
>  - ols_assign.py - turned in for Ames, Iowa 2008 housing dataset
